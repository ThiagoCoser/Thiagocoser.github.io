						<h2 style=" color:black ">Petrobras - VR</h2>
						<h3>Art Direction, Design and Technical Artist</h3>
						<p>This virtual experience was conceived for RIO2C, one of the largest technology fairs
							 in Brazil, by Petrobras, the largest oil company in Brazil and in the world. In this VR, you operate an
							 interactive ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) to complete a mission in ultra-deep waters. At the end of the experience, the participants received
							 virtual cards of the species they managed to scan during the adventure. This VR also included haptics and some cooling rig to be more immersive.
							  I had many roles on this project as Art Director, Storyboarding with the client, Technical Artist, Managing Outsourced Art assets, and  
						 making coffee.
